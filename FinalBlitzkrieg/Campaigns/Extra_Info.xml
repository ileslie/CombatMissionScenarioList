        <additional_info>Guys, these are my designs. They are memory heavy, lots of units, so save often. I used about 30-40 saves per campaign, especially at the end of scenarios. Then, if it crashes, (not often) you can reload the last and continue.

        <additional_info>The first of 3x campaigns covering the assault by KG Peiper in the Ardennes, December 1944.

This is a historical linear 7x battle campaign covering the first 48 hours of the action.

Happy to upload the individual maps/scenarios on request.

My thanks to Rastamon for advice, and Kohlenklau for Malmedy mods (one of which shown in the above pic), from the Battlefront forums.

        <additional_info>December 16th 05:35, the “Ghost Front” erupts in a maelstrom of noise and violence as Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein begins.

The Rollbahn D Campaign contains 35 linear scenarios built as historically accurate as I’ve been able to achieve. 

You control the fortunes of KG Peiper, SG Knittel, and Panzer Brigade 150, along with elements from KG Hansen, KG Sandig, and the 3. Fallschirmjäger-Division.

Boy did this project snowball!

The Campaign begins with a choice. Either starting at the very beginning or on Day 3 of the offensive. The latter will be an easier route as you’ll have not suffered any losses to your core units.

I’ve included here what it takes to progress within the Campaign as not every engagement is balanced. The scenarios range from small to medium to Ben Hur like epics. 

I’ve made minor changes to the Day 1-2 scenarios based on the feedback from the Rollbahn D Part 1 Campaign.
